Import the styles that you want to consume:

```scss
@import "~/living-styles/colours";
```

> Note: The tilde import syntax (`~/`) is webpack specific, otherwise adjust the import path relative to your `node_modules` folder.

Available imports:

- `colours` - hex code variables for every colour in Skyscanner's palette
- `forms` - mixins for form elements (light & dark backgrounds)
- `icons` - mixins for Skyscanner's icon pack
- `logos` - data uri variables for Skyscanner's logos
- `spinners` - mixins for spinners
- `units` - incremental unit variables for properties such as padding and border-radius
- `breakpoints` - mixins for working with the three standardised breakpoints - mobile, tablet & desktop
- `all` - all of the above

# Colours

`@import "~/living-styles/colours";`

Simply reference the variables as and when needed. Each variable uses the same naming convention of color name + intensity. The higher the intensity value, the darker the color.
- `$ls-color-blue-100`
- `$ls-color-yellow-800`

# Icons

`@import "~/living-styles/icons";`

Icons are available in two sizes, small @ 16px and large @ 24px. These are available in any colour using the following mixins.
- `@include ls-icon-lg(ls-icon-account-blue-500);`
- `@include ls-icon-sm(ls-icon-account-blue-500);`

# Forms
`@import "~/living-styles/forms";`

We currently have support for form elements on dark and light backgrounds

For example: `@include ls-label-dark();` will generate the relevant CSS properties for labels on dark backgrounds, whereas `@include ls-label();` will generate CSS properties for labels on light backgrounds.
- `@include ls-label();`
- `@include ls-input-text();`
- `@include ls-input-radio();`
- `@include ls-input-checkbox();`
- `@include ls-select();`
- `@include ls-textarea();`
- `@include ls-label-dark();`
- `@include ls-input-text-dark();`
- `@include ls-input-radio-dark();`
- `@include ls-input-checkbox-dark();`
- `@include ls-select-dark();`
- `@include ls-textarea-dark();`

# Units

`@import "~/living-styles/units";`

Simply reference the variables as and when needed e.g. for padding, margins, widths and heights.
- `$ls-spacing-sixth`
- `$ls-spacing-quarter`
- `$ls-spacing-half`
- `$ls-spacing`
- `$ls-border-radius-double`
- `$ls-border-radius-triple`
- `$ls-border-radius-quadruple`

# Logos

`@import "~/living-styles/logo";`

Logos are available in the 4 formats above You can use these like so...
- `$ls-logo-inline-blue-600`
- `$ls-logo-stacked-gray-900`
- `$ls-logo-cloud-blue-600`
- `$ls-logo-tianxun-white`

# Spinners

`@import "~/living-styles/spinners";`

Spinners are available in the 3 sizes above and can be coloured just like icons.
- `@include ls-spinner-sm(ls-spinner-gray-700);`
- `@include ls-spinner-lg(ls-spinner-blue-500);`
- `@include ls-spinner-xl(ls-spinner-white);`

# Utils

`@import "~/living-styles/utils";`

The following mixins are available as utilities (inspired by [html5 boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/)):
- `@include ls-hidden()`
- `@include ls-visually-hidden($focusable: (true|false))`
- `@include ls-invisible()`
- `@include ls-clearfix()`

# Breakpoints

`@import "~/living-styles/breakpoints";`

There are three viewport variable definitions:
- `$ls-breakpoint-mobile`
- `$ls-breakpoint-tablet`
- `$ls-breakpoint-desktop`

The following mixins are exposed to work with these breakpoints:
- `@include ls-breakpoint-mobile-only { /* your scss goes here */ }`
- `@include ls-breakpoint-above-mobile { /* your scss goes here */ }`
- `@include ls-breakpoint-tablet-only { /* your scss goes here */ }`
- `@include ls-breakpoint-below-tablet { /* your scss goes here */ }`
- `@include ls-breakpoint-above-tablet { /* your scss goes here */ }`
- `@include ls-breakpoint-desktop-only { /* your scss goes here */ }`
- `@include ls-breakpoint-below-desktop { /* your scss goes here */ }`
- `@include ls-breakpoint-above-desktop { /* your scss goes here */ }`

For outer container elements and overall page layout, use the following mixin:
- `@include ls-container();`

# Base Stylesheet

`@import "~/living-styles/base";`

- A minimal, relatively un-opinionated base stylesheet
- For improved cross-browser rendering, we use [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) to correct small inconsistencies across browsers and devices.
- The `box-sizing` is globally set on every elementâ€”including `*:before` and `*:after`, to `border-box`. This ensures that the declared width of element is never exceeded due to padding or border.
- Utility classes based on the utils mixins above, including: `.hidden`, `.visuallyhidden`, `.visuallyhidden.focusable`, `.invisible` and `.clearfix`
- That's it!
